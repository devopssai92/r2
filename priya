A close-knit loving bond between two people can begin with a friendship. 
Whether it is a friendship between two males, two females, 
or one male and one female, these friendships will develop into love.
 In no way is it a romantic love,
 but this type of love connects and bonds friends.
 Friends may move away or friendships may wane, but the love between the two people burns on forever.
